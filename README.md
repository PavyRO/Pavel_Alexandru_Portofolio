# Project 2: Analize California house pricing zones with clustering
### Result:
- After i did data wrangling, i used K-MEANS algorithm to cluster the data based on zone and price.
- We can see that the price is higher when the house is on the beach side. The low cost houses are in the middle zone
- Plot legend: 1(LOW PRICE) -> 5(HIGH PRICE)
